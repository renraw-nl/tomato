# Tomato

A timer-keeper app, usable from the CLI initially and, later, through a web interface.

Creates a toml file with the times registered and allows a form of reporting.

Essentially, it is a playground for various techniques and very much in progress.

## ToDo

* `start`
* `switch`
* `end`
* `pause`
* `report`
  * `csv`
  * `html`
  * `json` or `toml`
* `config`
  * `config.check`
  * `config.write`

## Ideas

### Sound on completions or errors

Make a sound to indicate if the program ran to completion or resulted in an error.

Have a CLI `quiet` option to prevent making a sound.
